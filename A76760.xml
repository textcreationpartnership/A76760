            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVEre it not that <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> in his Relation of I.

But seeing in this day of the Lords controversie for Sion, this son of Falsehood hath made a wide mouth, and drawn out the tongue to reproach &amp; blaspheme the Ttruth of the living God, and his servants, and sport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein. Necessity is laid upon me from the Lord to put pen to paper; not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For discovery whereof, and that the foot of the simple may be delivered from this Snare of the Fowler; I shall first wipe away what he hath cast on the Truth in a Reply to the sum of that part of his Book, which he makes to relate to the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as it is wrapt up in this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (for we must take it as he hath put it) <hi>viz. 1.

            <p>In answer whereunto To thee <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> I say, in the Power and Dread of the Eternal God, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee O Satan, even the Lord, who hath chosen</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the outcasts of</hi> Jacob.</p>

            <p>VVhilest <hi>I.

What mouth was there (then) opened against him that he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? What Pen replied again when he had answered? What Arm was stretched out against him that he did not chain down? What weapon formed against him prospered? How did he tread upon the high places of the Earth? How was he raised up from the North?

I say, his hour of Temptation being come, and Darkness getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him quick and sudden, his state was seen in the Light by Friends at <hi>London,</hi> before he was brought thence to <hi>Bristol;</hi> and being at <hi>Bristol</hi> the later end of the fifth month, (the time of the Fair) it was seen by Friends there how it had incompassed him; and that spirit which had darkned him, was then denyed by them, and also the Woman from whom it had entred him, and the other two with her, and all their Filth (whom not so much as one Friend owned of those thousands in that City, and the Country about it, as we have heard, or have known) from whom, after he had been some hours separated, he began to see, and to have some sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his condition, and of his loss, and to see the spirit which led out from God, and in that he continued during his journey to <hi>Exeter,</hi> towards <hi>Lancaston,</hi> whither he was going to visit his Friends there in Prison; and also in the Prison at <hi>Exeter</hi> (into which he and his Friends were cast for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, but for being found travelling on the high-way to visit those their suffering Friends) This tenderness in which he was drew forth, love in diverse, and bowels after his Recovery, and was the occasion of writing some Letters particularly by <hi>Iohn Audland,</hi> and <hi>Margret Fell</hi> (which this Priest doth so much abuse and wrest in his Relation; of which more hereafter) and in tenderness did he remain, till that some came to him thither, who tempted him again, and so he became again darkned; which being also seen in the Light, many Papers were sent to him, discovering that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that Woman, her company, and their imaginations, and judging of both; as there were also those who whilest he was in Prison, did to him and them bear the same witness as they were moved of the Lord; but the hour of temptation being strong upon him, and the Powers of Darkness, those
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111014:5"/> things prevailed little: And being delivered out of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Prison, he was led captive in the inward by it, and that Woman and her company to <hi>Bristol;</hi> in which condition Friends at <hi>Bristol</hi> seeing him (as they had before in the fifth month) they denied (as they had before) that spirit which had so led him, and that Woman and her company, with all their filthiness in their deceit, with which having no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Light, but the contrary, with the Light, they it, and them, and their deeds did reprove, and judge; and for that cause only stood clear of either owning or visiting them; yea, that Spirit, and Woman, and her company, and their actions did they publikely disown, not out of subtilty and deceit, as if so be something was brought forth which we did secretly like, but would not have them to be manifestd, or in that person, but some other (as this Priest doth wickedly invent and suggest) but that the Truth might (as it was) stand clear over all, in the Light of which that Spirit, and Company, and their actions were seen, denied, and testified against, both then and at first, and out of which are both it and them. And this is the plain and naked truth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the living God, of whom I am moved (being also an eye and ear-witness of many of these passages) thus to write, that this great stumbling-block may be removed out of the way of the simple: And that this is so, that of God in every man shall be my witness, in the measure of whose Truth I stand, &amp; in whose dread and fear I do bear this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which shall abide for ever.</p>

            <p>This Letter was wrote by me ont of <hi>George Fox</hi> his own hand-Writing, (vvhich Hand-Writing of his I have by me) and sent as it vvas vvritten by me from <hi>Reading</hi> to <hi>Bristol,</hi> to <hi>Dennis Hollister,</hi> vvith Directions for him to send it thence to <hi>Exeter,</hi> which he sent by a Messenger on purpose; and to <hi>I. N.</hi> it was delivered whilest he was at <hi>Exon</hi> a Prisoner; which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111014:6"/> being found amongst the rest of the Papers about him, so wrote, and so subscribed, and so full every way, for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth, and for the striking aside all that which was, or might be cast upon it by reason and occasion; as hath been said; for which thing sake such an opportunity was longed for, and greedily embraced: I say, the seeing of all that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly struck aside by that Paper, was that which tormented the Devil, and plagued this his Minister of Unrighteousness, and is the ground of his foaming up such a filthy deal of Mire and Dirt against <hi>G. F.</hi> and my self, and of his making such a sottish, confused stir and ado to render it pack't, feigned and false, and us the vilest of men, yea worse then those whom he therein affirms to be so abominable blasphemous; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the men against whom he pours out his indignation and murderous desires, and shoots his poysoned Arrows at those whom he thirsts to strike rather then the others, who by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of that Letter, and other things have been made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in the hand of the Lord, for the putting by his barbed Javelin, steep't in Aspine Venom, and hung out by the Powers of Darkness at the very heart of Truth.</p>
            <p>And before I go any further, it will be necssary to give the Reader one short instance, by which he may presently see of what a false and mischievous spirit this Priest is, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in his Relation.</p>
            <p>In the Copy of the Letter aforesaid, in the last line, he hath thus put it, <hi>The Light of God in ye all I</hi> am, <hi>but this I judge;</hi> whenas in the original Letter it is, <hi>The Light of God in ye all I</hi> own, <hi>but this I judge:</hi> By which foul and dishonest dealing he holds him forth to the Reader, as saying that of himself which is onely said of Christ Jesus, by whom the World was made, who is the Light of the World, and so (consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as a Blasphemer under his own hand (which is what he would fain make him, and have him to be if he could, that in his blood he might wash his hands, and strike at the Truth which he witnesseth.) What difference there is between <hi>I own,</hi> and <hi>I am,</hi> especially in this place; and what a devillish wickedness it is to forge in such a word, as for it, were it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111014:7"/> so, he would take away his life; and what credit there is to be given to what such a one saith, affirms or records (who saith of his Narrative (in which he so unfaithfully deals) in the Title-page, That it is a [<hi>True] Narrative</hi> and <hi>Relation:</hi> And in his Epistle, <hi>That he can and doth faithfully assure the Reader, That there is nothing there b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And is it not manifest that this his act is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? For if indeed he had so wrote, would not this Priest (think ye) who hath breathed forth such slaughters against him and us (as his Narrative witnesseth) now that he had got such a plain word under his hand, to prove him to be what he endeavours to make <hi>I N. for which he expresseth, and hopes the Parliament will give him Execution by some cruel</hi>
               <note place="margin">Narr. pag. 2. 30.</note>
               <hi>Death;</hi> I say, Would not this Priest (had this Word been truly so) instead of sending his <hi>Pursevant</hi>-Post to <hi>Damascus</hi> (as he did to pursue after the blood of <hi>I. N.</hi>) have posted up himself to have made the Information, procured some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Judgement; and, rather then fail, have been him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Executor of him, against whom he expresseth more bloodiness then against <hi>I N.</hi> that so he might have made an end of both the chief Leaders and Apostles (as he scoffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls them) of those people who witness the Seed of the Woman, which so intollerably plagues him and his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Seed of the Serpent; whose head it is come to, and shall bruise. Is not he that can do this past blushing? Is there any wickedness so great that such a one may not be well conceived to be ready to act? Is such a one a Minister of the Gospel? Words need not further to express such an Act, which in its very face is so manifestly VVicked and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, <hi>a wickedness not found in the Roll of those evils which the Apostle mentions should make the last dayes perillous.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore over against the line aforesaid, his Marginal-Note is, <hi>Obscure.</hi> Obscure indeed! Blackness of darkness in such foul Forgery. VVas it because he was so blinde he could not see
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111014:7"/> or understand what was in that VVord, who keeps such ado about Blasphemy, or to turn the Reader to minde that black VVork? which had it not been to do, and had not that word been forged, the Reader may assure himself how much both the Margent and the Book would have rang thereof as the most horrid Blasphemy. And whether what hath been said herein, be not what this thing speaks naturally, let the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Reader judge, who may also take notice, that this Priest hath in five several places of the Letter aforesaid, left out Words, (several of them considerable) and one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial part of a sentence, which in this place I shall not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mention, because of hasting to bring this Reply to the great Designe, End, and Title of his Book to a short period.</p>
            <p>Unto what hath been said might be added what this Priest hath set down as the Examination of that Woman through<note place="margin">Narr. p. 10, 11.</note> whom this hour came, who is made therein to confess, and he to publish that which of it self is enough to demonstrate and evince the Truth of what hath been said, <hi>viz.</hi> That with that Spirit and Company (who are from the Light) &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have no fellowship but the contrary; &amp; also to prove this Priest, and his design, &amp; Title, and Book a lye by his own Record; and many other pregnant-Testimonies of Truth could be produced in this case; but there being no need of such (what hath been said being full) I shall spare the sober Reader, who upon serious consideration of what hath been declared and produced, may finde enough already alledged and said in this matter; and also plainly perceive how these things have been Arrows in this Priest's Liver, sensibly in himself piercing through, and overthrowing his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of fixing all the filth, upon the occasion aforesaid, on the Truth; the witness and sense of which having sorely plagued and tormented his malicious Breast, hath constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him (for a little ease) to bring it forth in his Narrative, (to the cutting off, with his own hand and pen, his wicked Designe, and End, and Title, and Suggestions of that his Book, and the giving the lye thereunto, and to himself) and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111014:8"/> being so constrained, he casts it up covered with his loathsom Vomit and detestable Poyson, thereby to turn from it the eye of the Reader, lest the serious consideration of those things when they should be presented, should work in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an effect.</p>
            <p>But this Vomit and Poyson is swept aside, and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own Bowels, the Lake from whence it came; his smoak into the bottomless Pit; his Mire and Dirt into his raging Breast; his poysoned Arrows into his own heart; his mischief on his own head, and his violent dealing on his own Pate. (Take it to thee <hi>R. Farmer, for in the hand of the Lord there is a Cup of his Indignation, and of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured forth without mixture into it, shalt thou drink; and this shalt thou know when these things which thou hast done shall rise up in thee a Worm that never dyes, and a fire that never goeth out; the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it.</hi>) and the Truth stands clear and single, and its <hi>Throne exalted over the Powers of Darkness</hi> to every eye that sees, and heart that doth understand; and without having felt the least harm, hath it shook off this venemous Beast into the heat and fire out of which it came; and overthrown and raz'd down this Fortification of Satan, and pull▪d up its very Foundation by the Roots, <hi>viz.</hi> The Name, Design, and End of this Priest▪s Narrative, and all that he hath built thereupon to reproach and blaspheme the Truth of the living God, and those who fear before, and worship him in Spirit, as that whereby it is not reacht in the least.

What needs any thing further to be said? himself yeilds it; (but whether he had done so or no, that it is so, is sufficiently made manifest) What then?

            <p>How doth the Confusion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the people called <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> appear? Why <hi>here you shall see,</hi> (saith this Priest) <hi>Their two chief Leaders and their followers at Daggers-drawing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, which is a sufficient discovery of that Cheat of theirs, that they are led by One, True, Vnerring and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply:</hi> The People called <hi>quakers</hi> have denyed that Spirit that led into temptation, and that VVoman, Company, and their Actions, as being gone forth, and out of the Truth▪ as hath been already declared and proved, and this Priest hath granted it. And the People called <hi>quakers,</hi> who abide in the Truth, are one in the Truth, where there is no division. VVhere then is that which he calls the <hi>quakers</hi> Confusion? Doth any thing but his own Confusion appear? To name a a Book, as hath been said, and to write so many Sheets of Paper to prove them <hi>one</hi> in Principle and Action, and then to grant and affirm that they are <hi>divided;</hi> and then without fear or wit, to run away with it, as if he had gotten some great prise. <hi>One,</hi> and yet <hi>divided:</hi> VVhat Confusion is here! what sottish contradiction! Is not the <hi>Confusion,</hi> the <hi>Babel,</hi> the <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, like the Work of the Masons and Bricklayers, thy fellow-Work-men,

F.?</hi> Tis so, take it to thee, and the <hi>Cheat,</hi> the <hi>Deceit,</hi> the <hi>Imposture,</hi> who hast made a shew of one thing in the Title, and greatest part of thy Book to deceive the Reader, and now hast brought forth another quite contrary; the later part fighting against the former, and the former against the later; and these two are contrary, and in such vehement opposition, that the one cannot stand but in the destruction of the other (and they are both fallen together by the Sword of Truth.) And here take home to thee the <hi>Daggers-drawing,</hi> Page against Page; Line against Line▪ and the <hi>Cheater</hi> and <hi>Imposture</hi> is thy self; &amp; the <hi>vaunts,</hi> and <hi>confident Boastings,</hi> and <hi>high flying Pretences</hi> are thine own.</p>
            <p>And here I might end this Reply; but something yet lies upon me to declare and open further for the sake of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hearted, to remove this other <hi>great stumbling-block,</hi> which the Enemy by this occasion doth cast in the way, <hi>viz.</hi> That the quakers are <hi>divided;</hi> and to manifest what a high Blasphemer this arrogant Priest is by his own Argument, unto which I shall thus speake.</p>
            <p>Was that which led <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and gave forth the Law, <hi>false, erring, deceiving, fallible?</hi> VVas the Law of<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> God, and the true VVorship of the <hi>Israelites Confusion,</hi> a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> a <hi>Bauble?</hi> VVas <hi>Moses</hi> who brought them out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> through the Red-Sea, saying, <hi>I am hath sent me; thus saith the Lord, Let my People go: Hear O Israel; the Lord thy Goa is one Lord;</hi> an <hi>Imposture,</hi> a <hi>Cheat?</hi> VVas what he so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the Lord, and what he said in his Song, and what <hi>Aaron</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> boasted of the Lord and of his VVond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>High-flying Pretences, bragging Vaunts of Vnity?</hi> Because whilest <hi>Moses</hi> stayed in the Mount with God, receiving the Law, <hi>Aaron</hi> made <hi>a molten Calf of the peoples Ear-rings of gold, and fashioned it with a graving-Tool, and built an Altar before it, and made proclamation, and said, To morrow shall be a Feast to the Lord;</hi> And because the People said of the <hi>Calf</hi> so molten and fashioned, <hi>These are thy gods that brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and rose up early in the morning,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111014:10"/> and offer'd burnt Offerings, and brought peace-offerings, and sate down to eat and drink, and rose up to play?</hi> VVas <hi>Moses</hi> saying to <hi>Aaron</hi> hereupon, <hi>What hath this people done unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</hi> VVas his standing at the gate of the Camp when <hi>he saw that the people were naked (for</hi> Aaron <hi>had made them naked unto their shame amongst their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>) and saying, <hi>Who is on the Lords side, let them come to me; and all the Tribe of</hi> Levi's <hi>gathering together unto him, &amp;c.</hi> I say, Were these things which passed between these two (who were once their chief leaders) &amp; their followers, to be termed <hi>Daggers drawing one against another?</hi> Was this a sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that <hi>Cheat</hi> (as thou saith of the people called quakers) of theirs, that they were led by the <hi>one, true God,</hi> because of this? Were they all <hi>stark naught</hi> because of this, and <hi>a pack of cozening Imposters lying Mounteban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For if his Argument be of force to prove (the People called quakers) <hi>confusion,</hi> and that the <hi>one, true infallible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> by which they are led is a <hi>Babel, Bauble, Cheat,</hi> and <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi> and that all their bearing witness both by word, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and doing, their being led by that <hi>one, true, &amp;c. spirit,</hi> are but <hi>high-flying pretences, &amp;c.</hi> and that they are both <hi>stark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi> &amp;c Because G <hi>F.</hi> wrote so to <hi>I. N.</hi> as hath been said, &amp; the People called quakers disowned &amp; denyed them: And if this writing so, and denying them (which he in the words of a swaggering Companion calls <hi>Daggers-drawing,</hi> &amp;c. be (as he affirms it is) a sufficient discovery of that their <hi>Cheat,</hi> that <hi>they were all led by one, true, unerring, infallible spirit,</hi> &amp;c. (which is this Priest's Argument, he that runs may read it.)</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> who kept faithful with God and the Law, and worship of the one true God, the Rock which followed them, which was Christ, and all their glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be such as hath been said; and that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111014:11"/> it is so, <hi>Moses</hi> speaking so to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who had turned out from the Truth, from the true God, and set up a Calf, and the Tribe of <hi>Levi's</hi> gathering to <hi>Moses,</hi> in the denying those who had worshipped it, must be thereof a sufficient disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and all the children of Israel had been <hi>one,</hi> witnessing <hi>one, and the same true God,</hi> and were brought together out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Red-Sea; yea <hi>Aaron</hi> was the mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> unto <hi>Pharoah;</hi> stood over the Magicians of <hi>Egypt;</hi> executed the Plagues on <hi>Pharoah;</hi> was led by the Angel, and the Pillar, and the Cloud; was in the Mount with <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>saw God.</hi> And the Israelites saw the wonders of God, were brought out of Egypt, through the Red-Sea; feared the Lord; believed <hi>Moses;</hi> eat Manna from Heaven; drank of the Water that gushed out of the Rock; went out of the Camp to meet God, heard God speaking out of the Mount to <hi>Moses;</hi> a <hi>people</hi> whom God said to <hi>Moses, he bare on Eagles-Wings, and had brought unto himself;</hi> yet <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> made a <hi>Calf,</hi> and the people worshipped it, as hath been said. He that reads let him understand. Had an <hi>Egyptian</hi> seen this, would he not have said (as this Priest) It's a <hi>Cheat,</hi> &amp;c. what thou <hi>Moses</hi> hast said of the Lord God, to whom that ye may hold a feast in the VVilderness, thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all Israel to go with their VVives, little ones, Flocks and Herds, not a Hoof to be left hehinde; and now that ye are in the VVilderness ye are worshipping our Gods: It was but a <hi>cheating</hi> pretence; ye are not <hi>one,</hi> but are <hi>divided,</hi> nor is it one Lord that ye serve. (<hi>This made Israel naked amongst their Enemies.</hi>) Had this Priest been there, would he not have cryed out to <hi>Moses</hi> to have put <hi>Aaron</hi> to some cruel death for this? or to have whipt and burnt him, worse then death it self.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular, and to bar the door against this Priest, the Apostle saith, <hi>They were all under the Cloud, and all passed thorow the Sea, and were all baptized unto</hi> Moses<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note>
               <hi>in the cloud, and in the Sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink of the same spiritual drink; for they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111014:11"/> drank of the same spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ; but with many of them God was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for they were overthrown in the Wilderness.</hi> [All] were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>cloud;</hi> [all] drank of the same spiritual <hi>Rock, &amp;c.</hi> yet with many of them God was not well pleased, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the <hi>Rock</hi> was the same, and the <hi>cloud, &amp;c.</hi> and it was true, and no <hi>cheat,</hi> that they were all under it, and drank of it. The thing is so plain it needs no further demonstration. And the time was when these people whom we now deny, and we were one in the Truth; and therefore even on that foot, it is a truth what we said, That we were led by <hi>one Infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and no <hi>cheat;</hi> but the <hi>cheat</hi> is this Priests.</p>
            <p>And as in the instances of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, so the same (by this Priests Argument) may again be said of <hi>Moses, &amp;c.</hi> because of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note>
               <hi>who took men, even two hundred and fifty princes of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, men of Renown, and gathering themselves against Moses and Aaron, to whom they said, Ye take too much upon ye, seeing the congregations are holy every one of them, and the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 1 Kings 11.</note>
               <hi>them; and ye lift up your selves against the congregation of the Lord.</hi> And the same of <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; the Priesthood, because of <hi>Nadab</hi> &amp; <hi>Abihu's offring strange fire,</hi> who <hi>also had seen God.</hi> And of the Temple, &amp; the glory <hi>between the cherubims</hi> because of <hi>Solomon's</hi> hearkning to his Women, and <hi>worshipping stocks and stones, the gods of the Heathen, and building Altars unto them, to</hi> Chemosh: <hi>the abomination of</hi> Moab, <hi>in the hill that is before</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>and for</hi> Molech, <hi>the abomination of the children of</hi> Ammon. And of the true Worship at Jerusalem, because of ten Tribes <hi>sacrificing to the Calves set up by</hi> Jeroboam <hi>at</hi> Dan, <hi>and at</hi> Bethel, <hi>and</hi> Ahijah's <hi>declaring against the Altar in the presence of</hi> Jeroboam, and the Princes and the people, who<note place="margin">1 King. 13.</note> put forth his hand, and said, <hi>Lay hold on him,</hi> and his hand was dryed up. And of the return from the Captivity, and the second Temple, because of some of the peoples having taken Wives, and having children by the people of the Land, <hi>Moab, Ashdod</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s testifying against<note place="margin">Neh. 13.</note> them. And of Christ Jesus and his Doctrine, because of his

Acts 15. 1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> because <hi>Paul</hi> withstood <hi>Peter</hi> to the face at <hi>Antioch,</hi> for that <hi>he was to be blamed;</hi> and for that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>so sharply</hi> about <hi>John,</hi> whose sirname was <hi>Mark,</hi> so <hi>that they departed assunder one from the other;</hi> and for that <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>There must be Heresies</hi> also <hi>among ye, that they which are approved may be made manifest among yee.</hi> Yea, the same may be said of the Truth and of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and holy men of God from the beginning; for from the beginning in all ages were there some who turned out of the <note n="*" place="margin">Truth is the same, &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not.</note> Truth, because of whom the Truth was blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, against whom those who were in the Truth testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that sharply: Yea, by this Priests argument, there was never such a thing as Truth on the earth; And whether this be not to blaspheme <hi>God and his Name, and his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and them who dwell in heaven;</hi> And (to give thee <hi>R.

Not that this Priest, or his Generation, have hereby any advantage, for which I know they are gaping, for they are not come so far as to be in the Letter of the Truth, much less in the Truth, and therefore cannot be said to be turned out of it, nor that when any turn from them, they turn from the Truth, but from a lye.</p>
            <p>But though many have gone out of the truth in all Ages, making shipwrack of <hi>Faith</hi> and a good <hi>Conscience,</hi> and have set themselves against it, and have been denyed and testified against by such as have abode in the <hi>Truth;</hi> Nevertheless the <hi>Truth</hi> remaineth one, and changeth not, <hi>Yesterday, and to day, and the same for ever:</hi> For there is no lye of the <hi>Truth,</hi> nor in it is there any <hi>division;</hi> but out of it there is the <hi>Schism,</hi> the <hi>Division,</hi> the <hi>Confusion,</hi> and every <hi>Evill work;</hi> and though an hour of darkness is come, for a <hi>Tryal</hi> to try

            <p>And not by man, nor the Son of Man that must perish; but by the Spirit which is <hi>true, unerring and infallible,</hi> (for such is the Spirit of God, and the spirit that is not so is of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill) are we, as we abide in it, led into all Truth; and the leading of this Spirit we know, and the voyce and teachings of him who is given for a Covenant of Light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the Law written in the heart, the annoynting which we hear and follow, which shews us when any goe to the right hand, or to the left; in whose Light we saw when dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness came about him, and when those others went out of the Truth in which light we believe, and which light we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, not this man, nor that man, nor <hi>Paul;</hi> but as they follow Christ the Light; and where any follow not Christ the Light, such in the light of Christ we see, and from such we turn away, and so do we turn away from this Priest, and the men of his Generation who are out of the truth.</p>
            <p>Nor are we at a stand which to choose in the following of either, as this Priest impudently belies us, pag. 39. [They are thine own words <hi>R. F.</hi> take them to thee, and thy lye:] And this unto all who are sober, is an undenyable testimony in the behalf of Truth, and it shall stand for ever, That Friends in the Truth are not fickle or unstable, running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this man, and after that; or that their Faith stands in the wisdom of words, or is had with respect of persons, but in the power of God; for had it been so, this Tryal which is now come would above any thing that hath fallen out, or could have been desired by the enemy to have fallen out, for such a tryal, have made it manifest</p>
            <p>Nor let any man be deceived with that suggestion of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111014:13"/> Enemy, <hi>viz.</hi> That to such things as have been found on that Woman and Company they will all come, for such things are come, and they are seen, and denied by the children of Light, and the Spirit from whence they proceed, which is the Spirit of Darkness, as their fruits make manifest, which is this Priests great torment, having not so great occasion hereby against the truth as hee thought, or would make of it.</p>
            <p>Thus is the sum weighed and measured of this Priest's Book, which refers to the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as it lies in this confusion, 1. <hi>That they are one. 2. That they are divided.</hi> Whilest on them he vomits up his Filth and Poyson: He will needs have them to be <hi>one,</hi> so saith his Title, and the greatest part of his Book doth manifest it; when he can no longer dispute that with the witness to the contrary, then he saith they are <hi>divided;</hi> unto both of which the sober Reader hath a full Reply, and the Truth stands clear. But which of these two is it that thou wouldst have <hi>R. F.?</hi> canst thou tell? Or woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou have both? Wouldst thou have the first, <hi>viz.

And are not those who may be deceived, and may erre, such over whom the Devil may have so much power as to deceive and cause to err; for it is not possible that the Elect should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, saith Christ. And so in plain English, sayest thou, not to them who follow thee and the Priests as their Guides and Teachers, <hi>Will any people in the world, that are not infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and judicially given up by God to believe lyes, follow us for their guides and teachers, (especially as</hi> deny infallibility) <hi>over whom the Devil may have so much power as to deceive and cause to err, which we confess is true of our selves.</hi> And if <hi>poor people</hi> you will follow this Priest, or his Brethren any longer after you have heard him so say (and so his own words speak without the least wresting) <hi>Are you not infatuated, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially given up by God to believe lyes,</hi> as saith this your Priest? Heardst thou ever (Reader) of the like Sot, who sees not how he wounds himself with the Weapon he draws forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another?

How blinde is rage and envy? how sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish is madness.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the sum of this Priest's heap of Confusion, Lyes and Blasphemies, and of the deep and double design of Satan therein against the Truth of the living God; first, To render it most vile and abominable, by holding forth as <hi>one</hi> the people called <hi>Quaker,</hi> and those of whom he makes a Relation, whilest on them (through that occasion) he casts
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111014:15"/> up, and unloads his filthy poyson. Then to blaspheme the Spirit of Truth by which those people are led, as <hi>false, erring, deceiving</hi> and <hi>fallible,</hi> by affirming them to be <hi>divided;</hi> both which though so contrary as hath been demonstrated, yet having cover'd them over with the smoak of the bottomless Pit, through the opportunitie of what he makes the matter of his Narrative, he layes as <hi>great stumbling-Blocks</hi> in the way of the simple. But in the Light and Power of Truth the Filth is struck aside, and the Smoak scattered, and both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and removed, and the Truth appears single and clear from it all, to him who reads &amp; understands; for whose sake what hath been said is written, that being not ignorant of these devices of the Enemy, his foot may be preserved from the Snare, and his soul from the Jaws of the Devourer, which is the end (as hath been said) of this undertaking: And now he that will be deceived, let him be deceived. The Truth is clear, and I am clear of the blood of all men in this thing.</p>
            <p>And here I might end; but as the great designe of Satan in the Narrative aforesaid hath been discovered and made to appear so loathsom, that thereat the Passengers will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to stop their Noses; so this his Minister must be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made manifest, and the remainder of his polluted Bones scattered therein must be searched out, and a sign set at each, and be bundled up together and thrown into <hi>Tophet,</hi> that so the Land of them may be cleansed; which I shall pass through briefly.</p>

               <p>Reply. What is this but in plain <hi>English</hi> to say, That they are guilty men? who though they are not so bad as some do make them (nay not by very much, as thou sayest; but who will believe thee; who as to faith and honesty art proved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate?) yet bad men they are, and cannot be excused. They cannot be excused, why? who accuseth them? Where is their Charge, that thou thus pleadest them guilty? Doest thou fight with thine own shadow? Or doth not thy thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of them, and recording their Names as evil in thy Roll of those thou callest most horrid and abominable blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers and Impostors, make it to appear that thou hast a minde to abuse them under colour of a vindication? What makes thee thus to bring them on the Stage? What occasion have they given thee to draw on them so black a Character? Canst thou let none alone, Friend or Enemy? Or knoweth not thy rage how to spare, or thy madness to put a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? They cannot be excused, how comes this in? Where's that unto which it doth relate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And indeed</hi> (sayest thou) <hi>what men are there (Magistrates or others) that have not their</hi> [spots] <hi>their defects, failings?</hi> (What fine words have the Ministers of Satan got, wherewithal to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over transgression, that it may neither look gastly, nor

               </p>
               <p>Reply: Thou who art in the Transgression, neither seest nor knowest any other of men or Magistrates then Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, spotted men, Evil-doers; thou canst not see where thou hast not an eye, and so mayest well ask the question, and minister for the Kingdom in which thou art, and uphold sin by demanding who are them that are not sinners. But the Sword of the Magistrate of God is to pass upon thee and thy Magistrates, who are men of [spots] Evil-doers, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, and ye will one day finde it, whether to salvation or eternal Wrath.</p>
               <p>This then is the <hi>English</hi> of this thy Vindication; Evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they are of the generation of Evil-doers, no Magistrates of God, but such to whom the Magistrate of God is a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And what couldest thou record worse of them whom thou callest Magistrates?</p>
               <p>Yet thou hast one Argument more for them of the like nature, and another for thy Master, <hi>Look upon</hi> (sayest thou) <hi>the best Kings and Governors, whose Praise are in the Scriptures, and ye shall finde that they were men, and so were (in diverse things) defficient and imperfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply:</hi> The record of evil-doing is a <hi>Curse;</hi> the name of<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 7.

So where the <hi>Curse</hi> is, there hast thou recorded thy Magistrates of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and so of them thou leavest <hi>a curse to be the Name and Memorial,</hi> and of thy self too, who to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Iniquity, hast thou not blasphemed both the holy men of God and the Scriptures? The Holy men of God, in affirming that <hi>the best of Kings and Governors were men, and so were (in diverse things) deficient and imperfect;</hi> that is to say, <hi>Men of sin,</hi> Evil-doers, for there is the deficiency, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 8.</note> So that the best of Kings and Governors on Record in the Scripture must be Evil-doers, and the Scriptures must be a Praise to such, to serve this thy Record of the Magistrates, whose Name thou hast Registred a Curse unto Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>But to come (briefly) a few particulars.</p>
               <p>Thou set'st forth thy Magistrates in thy Book, First, as <hi>weak</hi>

How strange a thing is it that thou wilt neither become a kinde Master, nor a dutiful Servant? And in what a case are thy Magistrates, that the offering up of their Consciences, Names, Persons, Money and Victuals to thee, and all their fair words and advisings, doth not altogether render them free from the condition the poor <hi>Indians</hi> are in under the Dominion of the Devil? Would not all these abuses suffice thee, but thou must record them as aforesaid? In honesty (knewest thou what it meant) thou shouldst have returned them their money first, and other benefits, before thou hadst turned thy Pen upon them. If they like such services, they may go on to give more liberal Wages, that of the like they may have a more liberal Return, and of any man thou art he who art most like to give it. This is thy Vindication.</p>
               <p>To draw to a conclusion of this particular; Thou of any man (indeed) art best able to charge the Magistrates home, as having [spots] as spotted-men, because thou hast not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been privy to their counsels, but at thy restless sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath it been (much of thy time being spent at the <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey,</hi>

               <p>And as to what thou hast herein charged us, all who are sober may consider what thing should move us (who have some of us tasted of as much, yea more of the Power and Glory of this world as any in this City▪ and might still have it, could we bow down and worship) to joine unto such a persecuted and despised people▪ who are every where trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon, and delivered up as a prey to unreasonable men; who are laid as the ground to pass over, over whom all pass, and who are our selves with them passed over, and made a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, and a gazing-stock, the Song of the Drunkards, a

But over all thy filth and rage, and the unrighteous and unworthy Returns of this Town &amp; others, for their faithfulness and service do they stand, bearing all things, and suffering all things in the patience and long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of him who made them faithful and active to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, and passe through all in the other. And for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end made they use of their power in their day, then for the Common-Wealth, and the general good of all, even of their Enemies, so far as the Common-Wealth was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prejudiced not to set up themselves to serve their private ends and advantage (let who can charge and make good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them one particular) as is the maner of some. And all they then did, &amp; the <hi>contests</hi> they then had with thy <hi>mingled</hi> people vvas for the Common-Wealth, vvhich thou slanderest with <hi>faction, discontent, disaffected humor, pride,</hi> &amp; <hi>affected singularity;</hi> but the answer of a good conscience they have with God in these things, and are able (through his strength) herein, and in any other particular whatsoever, to stand before the

And this those who [then] sate at the Stern well knew, and found the effects answerable to the Trust and Power committed to their hands; therefore they Commissioned them as to all things wherein the safety of the Common-Wealth is concerned. And in that day who but thou [<hi>R.

But hath not that thy former Discourse been long since answered? Yea, <hi>by Audland</hi> (thou saist.) Hast thou Replied unto it? Nay, <hi>which I never have, nor ever shall make Reply unto.</hi> (These are thine own words, pag. 43.) What! <hi>Which I never have, nor ever shall make Reply unto▪</hi> and yet after near two years time dost thou produce that Book of thine in proof of the same Accusations; how dost thou shew thy self here void of <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>understanding?</hi> And what greater advantage couldst thou give him whom thou accountest thine Adversarie, against thy self in such a thing as this, before the People amongst whom thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be esteemed, and hast vaunted and gloried? He hath laid thee (in that his Answer) on the ground, and concluded thee, as to it, under silence hither to, and thou hast bound thy self under it for ever. Was ever such pittiful stuff spread before the Sun?</p>
               <p>Ay, but thou hast somewhat more to say for thy self in proof, <hi>This is no other</hi> (sayest thou) <hi>then I did foresee, and foretell, as may appeare in my BOOK aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>

               <p>Rep. Thou wouldst needs be accounted some great PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHET. But let me ask thee, By what Spirit didst thou <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi> and <hi>foretell?</hi> The Infallible SPIRIT thou hast not, so thou hast confessed, pag. 34. and the SPIRIT of the Lord is Infallible: Is it not then the <hi>Witch,</hi> the <hi>fallible</hi> Spirit that is <hi>out of the Truth,</hi> that hath divined, seeing that the Spirit that doth <hi>foretell,</hi> and which is not the Spirit of the Lord is such, hast thou then mended the matter? But further, Is not this thy foretelling a Lying Divination? It must be so, or thy proof is a lye, or both; I shall prove thee presently. In the Title-Page of that thy Book, viz. <hi>The great mystery of Vngodliness,</hi> wherein thou saist, <hi>As may appear,</hi> &amp;c. Thou sayest, <hi>Which is [most probably] manifested a little before their time;</hi> and here thou saist of it, <hi>This is no other then I did foresee and foretell.</hi> So that which thou saist here, <hi>I did foresee and foretell,</hi> is, but <hi>most probably</hi> in that thy Book, where thou saist, <hi>it may appear;</hi> and whether <hi>foreseeing</hi> and <hi>foretelling,</hi> &amp; <hi>most probably</hi> be the same, let the wise judge? And how thou makest one Book of thine to belye the other, and both to give thy self the lye, and to prove thee a false Prophet; for, <hi>Certainty</hi> cuts off <hi>Probability,</hi> and <hi>Probability</hi> is not <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> though in two yeers time thou wouldst have it grown up so to be; and <hi>fortelling</hi> must be as of a thing <hi>Certain,</hi> not <hi>Probable;</hi> otherwise it is not <hi>foretelling.</hi> And how canst thou expect but to have a false Prophets Reward? how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of understanding dost thou manifest thy self, as not to consider what thou sayest in thy Books before thou bringest them one against another, and both against thy self, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in such a matter as foreseeing and foretelling of what thou callest such high Blasphemies▪ If thou thus dealest with thine own quotations of thine own Books in such a business of consequence to thy Reputation as this, what credit is to be given to what thou quotest of others? But what if they had said at first as Christ did, <hi>Ioh. 16. 12. I have many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now;</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 3. 2.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:111014:40"/> it therefore follow, that <hi>they (no doubt) thereby meant</hi> as thou hast affirmed? would not thy Spirit have said to them in that day the same as thou hast to these in this?</p>

(More instances could be brought, but I forbear) What contradiction is here? Is one, every one? and that it is every one, doth it appeare by one, doth one prove it?

               </p>
               <p>Rep. That Deposition is already proved false, and thy Dishonestie and Wickednesse therein manifested, who didst procure the boy to Swear, that thou might'st bring it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth; and now thou hast produced it for that purpose, hast left out the place where he deposed she spake, <hi>viz. The Orchard neer the Ware,</hi> where she never spake at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:111014:42"/> Meeting, nor any such words, or to such effect at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place in this Citie. And the Record of the Deposition taken before the Magistrates, is a Testimonie against thee in this thing of the Orchard.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding thou thus concludest therefrom, <hi>So that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note>
                  <hi>you see, It is not that Iesus Christ, but some other; for as for that Christ in the flesh, with all he did and suffered therein, he was but a Figure, and nothing but an Example, say they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rep. These are other words then those in which thou hast delivered, what (thou saist) is the Principle, and will bear a different signification. So thy ground is one thing, and thy confusion another; about which I shal not further spend time; but this is a lye, they never said so, but the contrary; nor hast thou proved it in the least, nor any thing that thou hast charged upon the people called quakers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, nor on any of them in particular, as their Doctrine or Principle, or the drift of either. It is false what thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, Principle and Practise, Ground and Conclusion, Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and Evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say they!</hi> how provest thou that <hi>they say</hi> so? Thou addest,<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note>
                  <hi>Which words stand charged against them in the</hi> Perfect Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see; <hi>and for this is quoted the quakers Book called,</hi> Sauls Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to Damascus, <hi>where (as 'tis asserted) it is expresly found, and is agreeable to that Expression before of</hi> M. S. <hi>in her Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rep. Still ye quote one another (as hath been said) for proof of your false Accusations, and if it were not for this, where would a charge be found, or pretence of proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth? Ye Priests are the men who in this day are found at this Work. The <hi>Perfect Pharisee</hi> hath been long since answered, as hath been said; but thou bringst him in as others have brought thee, who hast been also answered;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111014:42"/> and its like this thy heap of Lyes wil be made by the men of thy generation a ground of blaspheming against the Truth, and be produced as Proof, if this Vindication (happily) prove not a check to some of them who are more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and warie. And for that of <hi>Sauls Errand to Damascus,</hi> all that thou saist is, <hi>Where (as it is asserted) it is expresly found, and which is quoted;</hi> but by whom thou saist not, or that thou knowest it is so, or that so it is; and this thou wouldst have stand as good proof (if any are so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as to take it) of so high a <hi>Charge.</hi> And as for <hi>M S.</hi> let the sober read and consider what thou hast recorded as her Examination, and see whether there be any such words therein, or <hi>agreeable thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I punctually gone through, and weighed thy <hi>high Accusation</hi> of the Doctrine and Principle of those Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and what (thou saist) is <hi>the Drift of them,</hi> and all that thou hast produced in Evidence, as they have lain in thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; not that any thing thou hast alledged deserves any such thing, or otherwise then to manifest thee, and to be thrown with the rest of thy Bundle into the Lake from whence it came without Reply, but for the sake of those whom thou seekest to possess with strange thoughts of, and prejudice against the Truth, by these thy loud Outcries, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, false Charges and Accusations, which are (and thou) thus found faultie in such a foul and gross degree, as the like thereof (I suppose) hath not been made publike. The serious Reader may consider of the one and the other (for I cannot further enlarge, being to hasten to an end) and judge whether thou hast not greatly advantag'd the Truth in thy thus highly charging it, and yet appearing so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly false, slight, and silly in the proof thereof, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an unavoidable necessitie hath not enforced me to be thus particular.</p>
               <p>And now should I be so in the scanning of the remainder of thy Book relating to those People contained in the 19, and 29. and so forwards to the 44. page, I should seem to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111014:43"/> be but at the begining of my work, &amp; must crave more sheets of Paper to finish it, then the whole of this Vindication hath required; such a manifest bottomless pit it is of Lyes, Lightness, Slanders, Reproaches, false Accusations, Scoffs, Jeers, and unclean Language, so gross and noysome, and so irreconcilablie contradictorie and opposite each piece with another, without Foundation, or Consistencie, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perusing of it may suffice to make it appear so to the discreet and sober Reader: Therefore I shall only point at a few particulars, and so draw to a conclusion.</p>
               <p>Pag. 34. Thou raisest an Objection, <hi>But pray forbear</hi> (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est<note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> thou) <hi>will some say, Are they Knaves because they fall out, and differ, and disagree? what are you Priests then?

But if it be either of us, or both that thou meanest, or my self ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as it seems to be) Thou art a wicked and false Accuser; for as the things which thou doest intimate were never done by either, or both of us; so have we always had such a witness against such deeds of darkness, as nothing can be more then

To close this par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticular, Thou art the man who hast been manifested to have <hi>procured Lawrence Reymund</hi> to swear, on purpose thereby to serve thy <hi>design</hi> in it to reproach the <hi>Truth;</hi> which <hi>Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is false, as hath been made to appear at large in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this <hi>Vindication.</hi>
